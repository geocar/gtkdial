gtkdial adds a "dial" menu option to all your gtk popup menus,
whenever it notices you're near a telephone number.

To use it:

1. Create a script called "dial_helper" and put it in your path.  Look in examples/*
   for some samples that work for Asterisk and Ekiga/GNOME users.

2. Run ./configure && make && sudo make install

3. Make sure wherever you install it, you add that directory to your ld.so.conf:

	sudo sh -c 'echo /usr/local/lib/gtk-2.0/modules >> /etc/ld.so.conf'
	sudo ldconfig -v

4. Arrange for gtkdial to be loaded at login-time. Most GNOME systems have a ~/.gnomerc
   that you can use:

	echo GTK_MODULES=${GTK_MODULES}:gtkdial >> ~/.gnomerc
	echo export GTK_MODULES >> ~/.gnomerc

5. Logout, login.
