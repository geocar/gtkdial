These are some (potential) future directions for gtkdial

* Figure out how a gmodule can support internationalization
* An interface to configure dialing plans (help in recognizing phone numbers)
* A program for interpreting dialing plans, and converting to a canonical form 
* Generalize gtkdial to support sending email when an email address is "detected"
* An interface to control sip: and tel: url handlers, and point them at the dialer interface
* A control panel for configuring the dialer (and plugable dialers)
* Convert the dialer-interface to using dbus
* Add support for a WEBKIT_WEB_VIEW and/or other types that support populate-poup
* Get views containing hyperlinks to underline telephone numbers (epiphany support)
* Firefox and/or chromium support

I may or may not implement them. If you're interested in developing one of them,
let me know and I'll provide advice.
